## Getting Started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites
* [Android Studio]() 4.0 or later.
* You should have a good knowledge of [Kotlin]() language.

<!--### 2. Getting GoNotes Repo
First you need to get GoNotes Repository to you local machine or PC.
You can do either of following :
* You can clone this repo, [click here]().
* You can download .zip file of this repo by clicking [here]().
-->

### 2. Cloning Repo

```
cd GoNotes 
```
* Step 3
```
git status
```
If above commands did not output errors or red marks, then you're all set.

### 3.Running the app
The project contains a [`staging`]() variant that replaces some modules at compile time so they don't depend on remote services such as Firebase. This allows you to try out and test the app without the API keys.

### Development Environment
The app is written entirely in Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system.
To build the app, use theÂ `gradlew build`Â command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio. 


# Versioning
We useÂ **`X.YYYY.Z`**Â for versioning. For the versions available, see theÂ [tags]() section of repository.
Where : 
* `X` is Version Code
* `YYYY` is year of latest relaese 
* `Z` is name of relaese for year YYYY. This can be any integer or integer with a -beta-integer suffix.

Eg. `1.2022.5`, `4.2023.2-beta01`

## Open Source Libraries Used
* [Room Database]()
* [Google Material Design]()
* [Firebase]()
* [Androidx]()
* [Kotlin]()

### Firebase
The app makes considerable use of the following Firebase components:

* [Cloud Firestore]()Â is our source for all user data (events starred or reserved by a user). Firestore gave us automatic sync and also seamlessly managed offline functionality for us.
* [Authentication]() is our authentication system. Firebase Auth gave us ability to integrate Google SignIn into our application. This Google SignIn is optional, incase the user wants to backup all the notes, we integrate with google sheets of users account to backup the notes in a format that we can retrieve them back.

### Kotlin
The app is entirely written in Kotlin and uses Jetpack'sÂ Android Ktx extensions.

Asynchronous tasks are handled withÂ coroutines. Coroutines allow for simple and safe management of one-shot operations as well as building and consuming streams of data usingÂ Kotlin Flows.

All build scripts are written with theÂ Kotlin DSL.
